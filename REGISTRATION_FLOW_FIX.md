# Registration Flow Fix

## 🐛 **Bug Fixed: Auto-Login After Registration**

### **Problem:**
Users were automatically logged in after registration without needing to enter their credentials. This bypassed the intended login flow.

### **Root Cause:**
Firebase's `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` automatically signs in the user after account creation. The `onAuthStateChanged` listener then picks this up and loads user data, effectively logging them in.

### **Solution:**
Added automatic sign-out after successful registration to force manual login.

## 🔧 **Changes Made:**

### **1. AuthContext.tsx**
```typescript
// Before: User was automatically logged in
await setDoc(doc(db, 'users', signupData.nic), userData);
await loadUserData(result.user); // This auto-logged them in

// After: User is signed out after registration
await setDoc(doc(db, 'users', signupData.nic), userData);
await signOut(auth); // Force manual login
```

### **2. Login.tsx**
```typescript
// Before: Generic success message
toast({
  title: "Account created successfully!",
  description: "Welcome to SaveToGather",
});

// After: Clear instruction to log in
toast({
  title: "Account created successfully!",
  description: "Please log in with your credentials to continue.",
});
// Reset form and switch to login mode
resetForm();
setIsRegister(false);
```

## ✅ **Expected Behavior Now:**

### **Registration Flow:**
1. User fills out registration form
2. Account is created in Firebase Auth
3. User document is created in Firestore
4. User is automatically signed out
5. Success message appears
6. Form resets and switches to login mode
7. User must manually log in with their credentials

### **Benefits:**
- **Security**: Ensures users know their credentials work
- **UX Clarity**: Clear separation between registration and login
- **Verification**: Confirms email/password combination is correct
- **Intentional**: Users consciously log in rather than being auto-logged

## 🧪 **Testing:**

1. **Register a new account**
2. **Verify you're not logged in** (should see login form)
3. **Log in with the credentials** you just created
4. **Verify you can access the dashboard**

## 📝 **Technical Details:**

- **Firebase Auth**: Still creates the account normally
- **Firestore**: User document is created with all required data
- **Auto Sign-out**: Happens immediately after account creation
- **State Management**: `onAuthStateChanged` listener handles the sign-out
- **Form Reset**: Registration form clears and switches to login mode

**The registration flow now works as intended!** 🎉
